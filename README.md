I will update when I come up with new valuable functions

<br/><br/>

### Collection of useful scripts for Unity:
Find and Get functions:
- GetAllChildren: returns all children transform;
- GetComponentInSibling: return component in sibling;
- GetKeyIndex: return key index from Dictionary;

Vector functions:
- Vector2 to radian and reverse;
- Vector2 to Vector3 and reverse;

Lerp function and overrides:
- yield return LerpTo can be used in Coroutine to "await" the lerp. Works with: floats, Vector3, Quaternion, and Vector3 to Quaternion;

Random:
- Random list shuffle;
- Random float, int, etc. //uses System.Random that created once, so random is more random Xp;
